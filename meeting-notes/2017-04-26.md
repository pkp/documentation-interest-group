Hey everyone, 

We had a brief call today (with a small number of members) and discussed a few things. Here's a summary of what we talked about. 

**Gitbook**

Looking to move to less reliance on GitBook and more reliance on GitHub. Translations features of GitBook are still very convenient for the group. 

The other major difference will be in where documentation lives. Because GitBook has a command line interface, we can generate versions of our documentation to _also live on PKP servers_, which we'll be doing sooner than later. These versions will likely update every 12-24 hours via an automated process and will live on pkp.sfu.ca/docs so that we may finally have a consistent home for all the good work done by the folks in this group. It should be more visible to the PKP community. 

So, TL;DR, we aren't leaving GitBook and your current workflow shouldn't change if that's how you work on documentation, but we should soon have more options for sharing and collaboration. 

**Looking Forward**

It's possible that PKP has a hard time seeing the forest for the trees when it comes to new documentation. _I'm asking members of the Documentation Interest Group to tell us your ideas for documentation we don't have, that you really wish we had_.  Sometimes excellent bits of information live only on the forum but are used regularly by the hosting team, these might form an initial collection of smaller texts worth converting to documentation. If you have any ideas for some documentation in this space, please let me know via the Slack channel or an email. Some of what we discussed today included: 

- documentation on how to start totally from scratch (without really knowing anything about servers)... this sort of doc would fall between the basics of learning OJS and the technical reference. Something like a less technical account of the basics of server information. 
- documentation on how to install OJS from Git. 
- documentation on hardening OJS security (currently lives on the forum)
- documentation on file permissions (also lives on forum)

Please don't be afraid to make any suggestions for what sort of document you might want to see. 

Finally, we discussed the PKP Code/Documentation Sprint occurring before the PKP Conference in Montr√©al this year from August 2nd-3rd. We'll be engaging in a documentation sprint, featuring the Getting Found, Staying Found document in particular.

**Housekeeping**

For the time being, our calls occur on the last wednesday of any given month, at 11am Atlantic Time, 7am Pacific.  The next few dates should be as follows: 

- May 31st

**Actionable Items**

[ ] mike to contact kurt/kevin about possible "read the docs" testing    
[ ] mike to contact hosting team about potential shared documents from the forum that might make for useful stand-alone documentation.
